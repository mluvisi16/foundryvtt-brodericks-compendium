      "value": "<p><em>Biome: Forests</em></p>\n<p>A broad oak that sprouts many branches and is often covered by a multitude of light green leaves. In previous ages, the tree was favored for the construction of bows. However, due to increasing rarity, the many nations of the realm have sought other sources of wood. The tree once thrived in the area now occupied by the foritified city of Drakkendale. However, many of the trees were felled during the construction of the city&rsquo;s Great Wall and have never grown back. Those few trees that were left have withered and perished, leaving behind ancient reminders of what once was in the form of large, hollowed tree stumps and decaying trunks.</p>",
